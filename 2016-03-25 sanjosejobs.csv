Serving customers in over 100 countries, our research scientists and engineers continue to invent and accelerate new technologies that will increasingly transform the way people and things communicate and connect.  The Nokia equipment (7x50 SR and ESS product line) enables carriers to build converged infrastructure for residential Triple play with IPTV, business Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and mobile networks which hitherto used to be three separate networks. It employs state of the art technologies like Hierarchical QOS, Layer 2 VPNs, Advanced Ethernet Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM), and Subscriber management per service. The product platforms allow companies to use legacy infrastructure so that investments already made are useful, and provide inter-working migration paths with legacy technologies like ATM and TDM.

In particular we are seeking researchers with the following skills and experience to contribute to Criteo in driving the future of ad targeting, personalization, content extraction, content matching and other prediction problems.  Your mission:  Click prediction: How do you accurately predict if the user will click on an ad in less than a millisecond? Thankfully, you have billions of datapoints to help you.Recommender systems: A standard SVD works well. But what happens when you have to choose the top products amongst hundreds of thousands for every user, 2 billion times per day, in less than 50ms?Auction theory: In a second-price auction, the theoretical optimal is to bid the expected value. But what happens when you run 15 billion auctions per day against the same competitors?Explore/exploit: It's easy, UCB and Thomson sampling have low regret. But what happens when new products come and go and when each ad displayed changes the reward of each arm?Offline testing: You can always compute the classification error on model predicting the probability of a click. But is this really related to the online performance of a new model?Optimisation: Stochastic gradient descent is great when you have lots of data. But what do you do when all data are not equal and you must distribute the learning over several hundred nodes?Are you interested in tackling such problems in an environment where your algorithms are deployed by a team that sits next to you?
