This person will provide a “data-driven approach” to our executives and internal customers to both improve our current operations as well as increase our sales. This position will report to the leader of Device Insights program at US Strategic Analytics Team (USAT).  About US Strategic Analytics Team (USAT): In today’s fast evolving technology world, one aspect remains common – reliance on Data to drive the next wave of innovation. US Strategic Analytics Team (USAT) is Samsung’s Center-of-Excellence that is driving the adoption of data driven decision making and product development across the company. Whether it is developing best-in-class solutions to leverage a 360 degree view of the Customer, generating actionable insights from Social Media in real-time or conducting machine learning techniques on Device-level data, USAT is powering a paradigm change at Samsung and the global industry. If you are passionate about Data, have the rigor needed to solve billion dollar problems and possess an innate entrepreneurial spirit to get things done, then USAT will give you the wings to fly in this exciting world of Strategic Analytics!  Necessary Skills / Attributes This position will be responsible to utilize the unique data asset from Device Insights to leverage actual device usage data to solve business critical problems. This would involve defining (with internal clients) the business challenge that needs to be solved, conducting the analysis/modeling/experiment and then providing the “answer” in a clear and business-friendly manner for our clients to take actionable steps. This position is just as much a business role as it is a technical one.  Synthesis of data assets: Samsung has a differentiated data set that combines actual device usage behavior with detailed demographic data for panelists under the Device Insights program. Having a full-picture of the evolving data assets is equally important as the judgment to source which data asset to solve which business problem. This will require close co-ordination with teams that handle and manage data within Samsung. Analysis: This will be the core work which requires sharp quant skills and can take several forms. Sometimes it’s a few simple calculations to determine which hypotheses we can rule out, or it could be design and analysis of a controlled experiment to understand the impact of our retail or marketing decisions on our business goals, or it could be an advanced model to determine store locations based on varying priorities of rental costs, ROI, product focus and/or target consumer. Realizing impact: Completing the analysis is not the end of our work – the final step is to help interpret the results in our business context to understand the “so what?” and advise the internal client/USAT on what this means for them, and how it should inform the decisions they make.

Operated by Stanford University on behalf of the DOE, SLAC develops and operates some of the world’s premier science facilities, including the first hard X-ray free-electron laser. Researchers from SLAC and other premier institutions around the world use our facilities to investigate some of the most exciting and important problems facing our society in areas such as clean energy, environmental science, biomedicine, and advanced materials.  The Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC National Accelerator Lab is the world’s first hard X-ray free electron laser. LCLS produces pulses of X-rays more than a billion times brighter than the most powerful existing synchrotron sources. Scientists use these highly focused, intense beams of X-rays to reveal the identity and arrangement of atoms in a wide range of materials. The tiny wavelength of X-rays enables study of the arrangement of atoms in metals, semiconductors, ceramics, polymers, catalysts, plastics, and biological molecules. The ultrashort duration of these X-ray pulses can capture images of atoms and molecules in motion. LCLS is operated as an international user facility, attracting hundreds of scientists from around the world to conduct first-of-a-kind experiments to study fundamental processes of chemistry, technology, and life itself.  LCLS has a well-established, centrally managed summer internship program for undergraduate students. Each intern is partnered with a mentor, typically a staff scientist or engineer, who directs the internship project during the summer. The primary goal of the program is to provide interns with a stimulating, real-world research and engineering experience.

It is being evaluated in multiple clinical indications where defects in the mitochondrial proteins and redox control have been well characterized.  Edison Pharmaceuticals’ research efforts are focused on the science of cellular energy and the development of drugs targeting the control of metabolism. Our first clinical indications are a group of diseases collectively known as “mitochondrial disease.” These diseases are frequently inherited and primarily affect children. They commonly result in severe neurological impairment and death. At present, there are no FDA- or EMA-approved treatments. Mitochondrial diseases share a common feature: defects in DNA that encode for proteins critical to the proper handling of electrons. The process of regulating the flow of electrons is known as redox control, and it is essential to the generation and regulation of energy. Thus, mitochondrial diseases are diseases of redox control.

Operated by Stanford University on behalf of the DOE, SLAC develops and operates some of the world’s premier science facilities, including the first hard X-ray free-electron laser. Researchers from SLAC and other premier institutions around the world use our facilities to investigate some of the most exciting and important problems facing our society in areas such as clean energy, environmental science, biomedicine, and advanced materials.  The Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC National Accelerator Lab is the world’s first hard X-ray free electron laser. LCLS produces pulses of X-rays more than a billion times brighter than the most powerful existing synchrotron sources. Scientists use these highly focused, intense beams of X-rays to reveal the identity and arrangement of atoms in a wide range of materials. The tiny wavelength of X-rays enables study of the arrangement of atoms in metals, semiconductors, ceramics, polymers, catalysts, plastics, and biological molecules. The ultrashort duration of these X-ray pulses can capture images of atoms and molecules in motion. LCLS is operated as an international user facility, attracting hundreds of scientists from around the world to conduct first-of-a-kind experiments to study fundamental processes of chemistry, technology, and life itself.  LCLS has a well-established, centrally managed summer internship program for undergraduate students. Each intern is partnered with a mentor, typically a staff scientist or engineer, who directs the internship project during the summer. The primary goal of the program is to provide interns with a stimulating, real-world research and engineering experience. Technical projects are matched to the interests and skills of each intern, as well as to the programmatic needs of the facility.
