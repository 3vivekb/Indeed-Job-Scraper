KEY REQUIREMENTS Position subject to pre-employment background investigation A one-year probationary period may be required Selectee must complete a financial disclosure statement A minimum background investigation is required  DUTIES: This is a research position engaged in professional scientific and engineering work which is systematic, critical, intensive investigation directed toward discovering, disseminating, and applying new or expanded knowledge in a professional discipline. The incumbent conducts systematic research in problem areas that are highly complex and of considerable scope. The researcher investigates modern microorganisms and environmental samples, ancient terrestrial rocks, and Mars/Europa analog rocks/minerals/ices to support the interpretation of mission data and the identification of 'habitable' exo-planets. He/she develops research proposals in response to research opportunities and publishes research results in national and international peer-reviewed scientific journals.   The researcher addresses two or more of the following categories of biosignatures: remotely detectable features on planetary surfaces (e.g. spectral reflectance of photosynthetic pigments) and characteristic temporal changes in planetary properties (e.g. seasonally-mediated cycles of biogenic atmospheric gases), cellular and extracellular morphologies, biogenic fabrics in rocks, bio-organic molecular structures, chirality, biogenic minerals, and biogenic stable isotope patterns in minerals and/or organic compounds. The incumbent identifies and characterizes biosignatures in microorganisms or natural samples by integrating measurements obtained from state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation. He/she contributes to the design of instrumentation for NASA missions through research that can enhance the search for novel biosignatures on other worlds.   The incumbent determines areas for investigation and provides advice and recommendations to colleagues regarding new approaches to scientific problems; and determines the extent to which objectives are accomplished and if changes are necessary. He/she recommends changes, redirection of effort, and additions to the basic projects to maintain desired objectives. The investigator contributes to the development and deployment of instrumentation for NASA missions, including testing potential spaceflight instrumentation in controlled laboratory and relevant analog environments, and the development of crucial testbeds for real-time problem solving.

In the heliosphere, the events start at the Sun and influence the atmospheres, ionospheres, and magnetospheres of Earth and the other planets in the solar system. Observations of these interactions provide data on the interaction of these bodies with the plasma environment and can be studied to advance theoretical development and validation. Similar processes occur around other stars and their exo-planets.  The wide variety of exoplanet systems being discovered offers a rich ground to explore. Even when restricted to Sun-like stars, the variety of activities is large ¾ our limited lifespan offers us a only a brief sample of solar activities, whereas comparative stellar astrophysics enables us to effectively study solar conditions over much longer timescales and so to explore solar and heliospheric activity of the distant past and future. The †Comparative Heliophysics Summer Program 2016† at NASA Ames will focus on the foundations of heliophysics and related disciplines as applied to stars like the Sun and planets like those in the solar system with similar formation histories and that are relevant to understanding the formation, evolution, and present state of our immediate space environment. The program offers also the opportunity to explore approaches to sensor development that address space-weather impact on planetary atmospheres.  It is intended to offer the participants an opportunity to carry out a serious program of research while interacting with colleagues. The primary focus is to seed and encourage new multi-disciplinary research through interactions with scientists of various backgrounds. It is expected that the investigations will lead to high-impact publications and opportunities to expand into new research areas.Up to 25 students will be selected through a competitive process organized by the UCAR Visiting Scientist Programs. In addition, three to five advisors will be recruited from NASA's Ames Research Center to participate in the Summer Program.  The program will last for four weeks from June 6 to July 1, 2016. Successful candidates are: •Currently enrolled as advanced undergraduate students** or graduate students in any phase of training, or first or second year postdoctoral fellows. **undergraduates in physics in their final years (Junior, Senior) with strong background in applied mathematics, numerical methods, and computer science including advanced programming language skills in C++ , Python, and/or FORTRAN.•Majoring in physics with an emphasis on astrophysics, geophysics, plasma physics, and space physics, or experienced in at least one of these areas.•Pursuing a career in heliophysics, or astrophysics or planetary science.

302,Palo Alto,VMware,US,"Wed, 02 Mar 2016 13:12:43 GMT","VMware NSX is a network virtualization platform that delivers the operational model of a virtual machine for the network. Virtual networks reproduce the network model in software, allowing complex multi-tier network topologies to be created and provisioned programmatically in seconds. NSX includes a library of logical networking services – logical switches, logical routers, logical firewalls, logical load balancers, logical VPN, QoS, and distributed security.  A self-service interface allows users to create custom combinations of these services in isolated software-based virtual networks that support existing applications without modification or deliver unique requirements for new application workloads. Similar to virtual machines in compute, virtual networks are programmatically provisioned and managed independent of networking hardware. Decoupling from hardware introduces agility, speed and operational efficiency that has transformed data center economics.
