Fortunately, something else is happening that holds new potential: the planet is becoming smarter. That is, intelligence is being infused into the way the world literally works — into the systems, processes and infrastructure that help billions of people work and live.Across the world, a distinctly different group of leaders is announcing its arrival. They are making decisions based on evidence, not on habit or opinion or “gut.” They are anticipating, rather than merely reacting, to events. They are seizing competitive advantage, but at least as often, they are re-framing the issues--in unexpected, often counter-intuitive ways. For example, we used to schedule our road repairs. Now we predict them. Marketers used to see you as a ""segment."" Now they see you as you. Law enforcement used to fight crime after the fact. Now they work to prevent crimes before it breaks out. City leaders used to be judged by how they responded after a crisis. Now they are judged by how well they anticipate one. IBM’s Smarter Planet journey began four years ago and took on added significance with the recently announced IBM Research – Africa lab in Nairobi, Kenya. This is the 12th IBM Research lab and our first lab dedicated to a whole continent. The lab will be located on the campus of the Catholic University in the Karen-Langata area in Nairobi.
